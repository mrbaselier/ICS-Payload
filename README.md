# ICS-Payload
This Python Script allows you to create custom network packages using Scapy. You can controll every aspect of the packages. Like in normal operation you can controll the "known" transport layers like Ethernet, IP, IPv4 etc. But this script defines some ICS/SCADA protocols giving you the ability to add the ICS/SCADA packages as a raw payload. This way you can send custom packages to ICS/SCADA devices (that use TCP as a transport layer) and controll these devices.

This is a dynamic script and might be updated from time-to-time.

**Dependencies:**
- Python3
- Scapy (pip3 install Scapy)
- Threading (build in)
- BinAscii (build in)
